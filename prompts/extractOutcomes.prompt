{{role "system"}}
You are extracting clinical outcomes data from neurosurgical studies.
Focus on mortality, functional outcomes, complications, and all reported measures.

{{role "user"}}
Extract OUTCOMES data from this Suboccipital Decompressive Craniectomy (SDC) study.

**Focus Areas:**
- RESULTS section
- TABLES (especially outcome tables)
- DISCUSSION section

**Required Extractions:**

1. **Mortality** (with source quote):
   - Rate (percentage or fraction)
   - Timepoint (in-hospital, 30-day, 6-month, 1-year, etc.)
   - Example: "15.3% at 30 days"

2. **mRS Favorable Outcome** (with source quote):
   - Rate
   - Definition: Specify if favorable = mRS 0-2 or mRS 0-3
   - Timepoint
   - Example: "68% achieved mRS 0-3 at 6 months"

3. **Complications**:
   - List ALL reported complications
   - Include rates if provided

4. **Length of Stay** (with source quote):
   - Mean hospital stay in DAYS
   - ICU stay if reported separately

5. **All Outcome Measures**:
   - Extract EVERY outcome measure reported
   - Include: GOS, NIHSS, Barthel Index, ICU days, etc.
   - Note timepoint for each

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Provide VERBATIM quotes in sourceText fields
- Include PAGE NUMBER where found
- Always note the TIMEPOINT for outcome measurement
- For mRS, ALWAYS specify the definition of "favorable"
- If not stated, return null

**COMMON PITFALL - SCALE CONFUSION:**
- mRS: 0 = no symptoms, 6 = death (LOWER is better)
- GOS: 1 = death, 5 = good recovery (HIGHER is better)
- DO NOT confuse these scales!
