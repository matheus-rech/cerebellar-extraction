{{role "system"}}
You are identifying control/comparator groups in medical research studies.
Determine if the study has a comparison arm for the SDC intervention.

{{role "user"}}
Check if this medical study has a COMPARATOR/CONTROL group.

**What to Look For:**
- Comparison groups (medical management only, EVD only, other surgery)
- Matched cohorts
- Historical controls
- Propensity-matched groups
- Before/after comparisons

**If NO Comparator Exists (Single-Arm Study):**
Return:
```json
{
  "exists": false,
  "type": "None",
  "description": null,
  "sampleSize": null
}
```

**If a Comparator EXISTS:**
- Set `exists: true`
- Classify `type` as one of:
  - "Medical Management" - Conservative treatment only
  - "EVD Only" - External ventricular drain without SDC
  - "Other Surgery" - Different surgical approach
  - "None" - If single-arm
- Describe the comparator group
- Note the sample size if available
